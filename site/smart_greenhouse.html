            <h3>I. Abstract</h3>
            <p>In this academic report, we will focus on the IoT-powered greenhouse system and the benefits of
                incorporating different networking mechanism in greenhouse farming. We will analyze the system
                architectures as a whole the role of sensors and actuators in particular, and its impacts on energy
                conservation and cost reduction. Furthermore, we will explore deeply the implementation of the cloudbased technology on plant growth and the overall management of the greenhouse activities. Ultimately,
                this report suggests some practical approaches to deploy such systems in the Seneca King Smart
                Greenhouse initiative. </p>

            <h3>II. Introduction</h3>
            <p>The world today is facing with the myriads of global issues. One of them, the population explosion,
                especially in developing countries, become a threat to the food supply security. In addition, traditional
                agricultural method seems vulnerable when confronting unprecedented weathers that caused by
                climate change.</p>
            <p>
                The rise of technology has led to an increase in innovative and sustainable farming methods, with smart
                systems at the forefront. One such system is the Cloud-based IoT greenhouse model, which utilizes
                various technologies such as cloud services and automation that not only provides a controlled climate
                for effective plant growth but manage and optimize the farming process remotely and effectively. </p>

                <h4>3.1. Overview of the System</h4>
                <p>
                    IoT network including sensors, actuators, embedded controllers, with the integration of
                    cloud service and a dedicated app will give the farmers more power to manage their
                    greenhouse remotely and effectively, to harvest better crops all year.
                    In the nutshell, the real time data collected from sensors and cameras at the farm are sent
                    to the cloud server to save in a data warehouse and process for analytic tasks. Users can
                    easily manage all the systems operating in the greenhouse via an app available across
                    devices (laptop/phones). It will assist farmers in making faster and better decision on
                    managing the greenhouse activities and plants development.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>The app offers a main dashboard for users to track the essential environmental parameters 
                    such as soil moisture, light, temperature, air humidity, and CO2 emission level for any
                    particular area the greenhouse along with the information of specific plants. With the help
                    of machine learning algorithm, it can predict the possibilities of disease development on a
                    plant and recommend steps that should be taken in an hour-basis. Eventually, the final
                    decision will be sent to the executing devices via network and will be carried out
                    automatically by actuators (such as turning on/off vent, cooling, heating, irrigation systems,
                    etc.) to maintain the optimal growing conditions for the plants.</p>

                    <h5>3.2.1 Enivronmental sensors</h5>
                    <p>Monitoring the environmental factors is critical to the growth of a crop. This becomes a
                        huge advantage for a plant being grown in the greenhouse where all climatic
                        parameters can be controlled and adjusted precisely customized for each specific plant
                        type. It avoids unpredicted natural weather conditions that will threat the crop while
                        allowing plants to grow faster, all year round. There are a number of parameters
                        important that needs great supervision such as temperature, air humidity, soil moisture,
                        nutrient level, CO2 level.</p>
                    <p>   
                        Each type of sensor requires different installation approaches. For example, a
                        temperature sensor should be placed at various heights within the greenhouse as
                        temperature can vary greatly at different heights. This method is suitable for vertical
                        farming where layers of plants are stacked vertically. Moreover, temperature sensors
                        are also put near vents or heaters to monitor their effectiveness. Humidity sensors, on
                        the other hands, are positioned near plants that requires specific humidity. Keep in mind
                        not to place them near the water sources such as irrigation systems as this can lead to
                        inaccurate readings. Nutrition sensors can be installed near the root zone where the
                        majority of the roots are located. All sensors should be dispersed into strategic places to
                        precisely collect the climatic parameter in different areas of the greenhouse. </p>

                    <h5>3.2.2. Camera System</h5>
                    <p>Images and videos are the other fruitful data sources that can be collected to better
                        monitor the growth of plants. A camera system is suggested to gather video timestamp
                        and high-resolution images to detect disease that would probably develop on plants.
                        Images are then processed to remove any noise or artifacts that may intervene the
                        analysis. This can involve techniques such as filtering, smoothing, and color protection.
                        Features that are relevant to disease detection such as color, texture, shape and size
                        information are extracted from the images. Finally, a classification algorithm will be
                        used to recognize patterns and features associated with known disease labels. The
                        power of image processing together with the computer vision technology help timely
                        identify locations and type of disease that is likely to develop on a plant. “According to a
                        study, the system used KNN cluster algorithm demonstrated high efficiency in both
                        monitoring plant growth and detecting diseases, 1.71 times faster than other normal
                        methods.</p>
